ML Data Cleaning and Feature Selection

In this assignment, you will use a dataset for predictive learning and check the quality of the data and determine which features are important.

Answer the following questions:

* What are the data types? (Only numeric and categorical)

* Are there missing values?

* What are the likely distributions of the numeric variables?

* Which independent variables are useful to predict a target (dependent variable)? (Use at least three methods)

* Which independent variables have missing data? How much? 

* Do the training and test sets have the same data?

* In the predictor variables independent of all the other predictor variables?

* Which predictor variables are the most important?

* Do the ranges of the predictor variables make sense?

* What are the distributions of the predictor variables?   

* Remove outliers and keep outliers (does if have an effect of the final predictive model)?

* Remove 1%, 5%, and 10% of your data randomly and impute the values back using at least 3 imputation methods. How well did the methods recover the missing values?  That is remove some data, check the % error on residuals for numeric data and check for bias and variance of the error.

For categorical data, calculate the accuracy and a confusion matrix.
